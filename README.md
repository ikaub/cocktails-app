# cocktails-app
This is the test application for the company I am applying for. While building this one, I have learnt a lot of new things about React Native. 
I strongly recommend you to pay attention to the react-native-fast-image library I have used while developing this project. 
If you have lots of images on your list, this library will improve the performance in unbelievable way.
To run the project start scripts:
npx react-native start (npm start if you have globally installed react-native-cli)
npx react-native run-android (npm run android)
I haven't tested this app on iOS, so I have no idea how it looks like on iPhone and how it actually works there.
